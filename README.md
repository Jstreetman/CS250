# Sprint Review Reflection

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
When working on my sprint project, I interpreted user needs by focusing on what the end user expected the software to do and why it mattered to them. I looked at the problem from their point of view and turned those needs into clear features. Creating user stories helped because they gave structure to the project. Each story broke down the user’s needs into smaller tasks that were easier to understand and complete. This made sure the program was designed with the user’s experience in mind from start to finish.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs follows an Agile mindset. I like to start with planning and  then move forward in small steps so that progress can be reviewed and improved along the way. During the sprint, we recognized  Agile practices such as sprint planning, and sprint reviews. These processes helped the team stay organized and flexible when changes came up. In the future, I want to keep using these methods because they make development more focused, collaborative, and adaptable.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating well, staying reliable, and being willing to help others when needed. During the sprint, teamwork was a key part of success. Everyone had different strengths, and sharing ideas helped us solve problems faster. I learned that being respectful and supportive helps create a positive environment where everyone can do their best work. A good team member looks out for both the quality of the project and the success of the group as a whole.
